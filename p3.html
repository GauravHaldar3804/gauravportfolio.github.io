        <a><p class="p1txt">Research: In the future, I will start by researching various obstacle avoidance algorithms and technologies, understanding their principles and applications.

            Choose Platform: I will select a suitable platform or hardware (e.g., drones, robots) for which I will develop the obstacle avoidance software.
            
            Sensor Integration: Next, I will integrate appropriate sensors, such as LiDAR, cameras, or ultrasonic sensors, to gather data about the environment.
            
            Data Processing: I will develop algorithms to process the sensor data in real-time, converting raw inputs into actionable information.
            
            Obstacle Detection: Using the processed data, I will implement algorithms to detect obstacles and determine their positions and distances from the platform.
            
            Path Planning: I will design path planning algorithms to calculate safe trajectories for the platform to navigate around detected obstacles.
            
            Collision Avoidance: Implementing collision avoidance algorithms, I will ensure that the platform responds promptly to avoid potential collisions.
            
            User Interface: I will create a user-friendly interface to configure and monitor the obstacle avoidance system's settings and performance.
            
            Simulation and Testing: Before real-world deployment, I will extensively test the software in simulation environments to validate its effectiveness.
            
            Field Testing: Once confident in the software's performance, I will conduct field testing with the chosen platform to fine-tune the algorithms.
            
            Iterative Improvements: Based on testing results and user feedback, I will continuously iterate and improve the obstacle avoidance software.
            
            Documentation and Deployment: Finally, I will document the software's functionalities and deployment instructions for others to use and distribute it accordingly.</p></a>
