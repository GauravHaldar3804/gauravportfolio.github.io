            <p class="p1txt">I have experience coding in C and I'm currently learning Object-Oriented Programming in
                C++. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS for web development, and I'm also
                learning Arduino software to explore the world of electronics and physical computing.

                Moving forward, I'm eager to delve into game development to create immersive and interactive
                experiences. I'm also interested in software development to build applications that solve real-world
                problems and improve user experiences.

                Furthermore, I aspire to venture into 3D modeling to bring my creative ideas to life and design visually
                appealing assets and environments. Combining game development, software development, and 3D modeling
                will open up exciting possibilities to create innovative and captivating projects.

                With a passion for learning and a drive to master these skills, I'm eager to embark on this journey of
                continuous growth and exploration in the world of technology and creativity.</p>
