        <a><p class="p1txt">I will start by researching the VTOL design, gathering information about its dimensions,
            features, and reference images. Then, I will choose a CAD software that I am familiar with or one that meets
            my needs to work on the model.

            I will create a basic 2D sketch, incorporating the top, front, and side views of the VTOL as a starting
            point. From there, I will extrude and shape the surfaces to create a 3D representation, such as the fuselage
            and wings.

            Adding all the intricate details like propellers, landing gears, and control surfaces will be my next step.
            I will apply the right constraints to ensure accurate dimensions and proportions.

            For moving parts like propellers or rotors, I will create separate components and then assemble them to see
            how everything fits together and interacts.

            During the process, I will perform checks to identify and fix any errors or inconsistencies in the design.
            Additionally, I will apply materials and textures to enhance the visual representation of the VTOL.

            If possible, I will run simulations to evaluate the VTOL's performance and make any necessary adjustments
            for optimization.

            Throughout the entire process, I will continuously review and refine the model until I am satisfied with the
            final result. It will require time and patience, but I will be willing to iterate and make improvements
            along the way</p></a>
